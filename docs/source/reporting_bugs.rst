Reporting bugs
==============

If you find any bug or *unexpected behavior*, please
consider submitting a bug report. To do so, go to
`Github Issues <https://github.com/martinparadiso/spin/issues>`_
section of the project, and create a new Issue.

The information you *should* submit is the following:

- Platform where ``spin`` is installed. For instance 
  *Ubuntu 20.04*.
- Version of ``spin``, which can be retrieved by running
  ``spin --version``.
- Brief summary of the problem:

   - what you did,
   - what was the response, and
   - what were you expecting.

Additionally, it will be helpful to provide a way to replicate
the problem, terminal outputs, logs, and anything you deem
useful.
